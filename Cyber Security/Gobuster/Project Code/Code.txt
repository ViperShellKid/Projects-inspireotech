Project Output & Analysis

Project Title: Gobuster-Based Web & Subdomain Enumeration
Target: https://resorts.mannatgroup.in
Tool Used: Gobuster v3.8
Environment: Kali Linux

1. Tool Setup & Verification

Gobuster was successfully installed using apt.

Version verified as Gobuster v3.8, confirming latest stable build.

Required wordlists were confirmed under /usr/share/wordlists.

Result:
✔ Tool installation and environment setup completed successfully.

2. Directory Enumeration (Basic Scan)

Command Used:

gobuster dir -u http://resorts.mannatgroup.in -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt

Observations:

Server actively responded to requests.

Several restricted files returned:

.htaccess → 403 Forbidden

.htpasswd → 403 Forbidden

History files like .bash_history, .sh_history returned 406, indicating request filtering.

Analysis:

The server is properly restricting access to sensitive configuration files.

Presence of these files confirms Apache-based configuration.

3. Status Code Filtering (200 OK Only)

Command Used:

gobuster dir -u http://resorts.mannatgroup.in \
-w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -s 200 -b ""

Discovered Accessible Resources (Status 200):
Resource	Description
/controlpanel	Hosting control panel page
/cpanel	cPanel interface
/webmail	Webmail login portal
/robots.txt	Search engine directives

Analysis:

These pages are publicly accessible.

/robots.txt may expose hidden or disallowed paths.

Control panel and webmail exposure increases attack surface.

4. Extension-Based Enumeration

Command Used:

gobuster dir -u https://resorts.mannatgroup.in \
-w directory-list-2.3-medium.txt \
-x php,html,txt -t 50 --status-codes 200

Key Files Found (Status 200):
File	Purpose
/wp-login.php	WordPress admin login
/readme.html	WordPress installation info
/license.txt	License disclosure
/robots.txt	Crawl rules
/webmail	Mail access
/controlpanel, /cpanel	Hosting interfaces

Analysis:

Confirms WordPress CMS is in use.

Exposed WordPress files can be used for:

Version fingerprinting

Login attack surface analysis

No direct exploitation attempted (recon only).

5. Redirect & Error Code Analysis
Status Code Patterns Observed:
Status Code	Meaning
200	Accessible resource
301 / 302	Redirect to valid pages
403	Forbidden (proper protection)
409	Application conflict
500	Server-side error
503	Service unavailable

Analysis:

Large number of 301 redirects shows proper URL normalization.

500 & 503 errors may indicate:

Legacy paths

Disabled modules

Error handling weaknesses

6. WordPress Structure Identification

Key Indicators:

/wp-login.php

/wp-admin/

/wp-content/

/wp-includes/

/xmlrpc.php (405 – Method not allowed)

Analysis:

WordPress is properly locked but still fingerprintable.

XML-RPC exists but restricted, reducing brute-force risk.

7. Subdomain Enumeration

Command Used:

gobuster dns -d mannatgroup.in -w subdomains-top1million-110000.txt

Discovered Subdomains:
Subdomain	IP
ftp.mannatgroup.in	50.116.93.192
mail.mannatgroup.in	50.116.93.192
webmail.mannatgroup.in	50.116.93.192
cpanel.mannatgroup.in	50.116.93.192
whm.mannatgroup.in	50.116.93.192
autodiscover.mannatgroup.in	50.116.93.192
localhost.mannatgroup.in	127.0.0.1

Analysis:

Hosting uses shared infrastructure.

Presence of FTP, mail, and admin subdomains increases reconnaissance scope.

localhost resolving to 127.0.0.1 indicates internal mapping (not exploitable externally).

8. Security Impact Summary
Positive Security Controls:

✔ Sensitive config files blocked
✔ Admin panels redirect properly
✔ XML-RPC restricted

Potential Exposure Areas:

⚠ Public access to /wp-login.php
⚠ Webmail and control panel discoverable
⚠ Server error responses (500/503) visible

9. Project Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrated the use of Gobuster for:

Directory enumeration

File discovery using extensions

Status code filtering

CMS fingerprinting

Subdomain enumeration

The results highlight how reconnaissance tools like Gobuster help security teams map attack surfaces and identify exposed resources without exploitation. Proper server hardening and access control were observed, with minor information disclosure risks identified.
