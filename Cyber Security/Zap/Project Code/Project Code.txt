Project Output & Detailed Analysis
Project Title

Web Application Vulnerability Assessment Using OWASP ZAP

Target Application

URL: https://srishtihospital.in/
Tool Version: OWASP ZAP v2.16.1
Scan Type: Automated Scan + Traditional Spider + AJAX Spider

1. Scan Overview

Total Alerts Identified: 24

Scan Confidence Levels: Low to High

Scan Coverage:

Static pages

WordPress dynamic content

Forms and POST requests

Scan Status: Completed (100%)

OWASP ZAP successfully crawled and analyzed the target application using both traditional and AJAX-based crawling techniques.

2. Site Structure Discovery (Sites Tree Analysis)

ZAP discovered and mapped the following key components:

Root domain: https://srishtihospital.in

WordPress endpoints:

/wp-content/

/wp-includes/

/wp-json/

POST-based form submissions (Fluent Forms)

Dynamic URLs such as:

/pt_doctor_type/*

/paged/*

/feed/

Analysis:
The application is confirmed to be WordPress-based with multiple dynamic endpoints, forms, and feeds, increasing the attack surface.

3. Spider Scan Results (Traditional Spider)

URLs Found: 5322

Nodes Added: 3398

Methods Observed:

GET

POST

Status: 100% completed

Analysis:
The traditional spider effectively crawled static and server-rendered pages, identifying a large number of accessible endpoints and content feeds.

4. AJAX Spider Results

Crawled URLs: 41

AJAX-based requests detected

Out-of-scope external resources blocked automatically

Analysis:
AJAX Spider successfully detected JavaScript-driven content and dynamic requests that traditional spidering might miss. This ensures better coverage for modern web applications.

5. Vulnerability Alerts Summary
5.1 Absence of Anti-CSRF Tokens (Medium Risk)

Total Instances: 2246

Affected Area: HTML forms (POST requests)

CWE ID: 352

Detection Method: Passive Scan

Description:
ZAP identified multiple HTML forms that do not contain anti-CSRF tokens, making them vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks.

Security Impact:
Attackers could trick authenticated users into performing unwanted actions without their consent.

5.2 Content Security Policy (CSP) Issues (Medium Risk)

Detected CSP-related misconfigurations:

CSP Header Not Set

script-src unsafe-inline

style-src unsafe-inline

Wildcard directives used

No fallback directives defined

CWE ID: 693
Confidence: High

Security Impact:
Weak CSP configuration increases the risk of:

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

Injection of malicious scripts

Client-side attacks

5.3 Missing Anti-Clickjacking Header (Medium Risk)

X-Frame-Options header not configured

Security Impact:
The website can be embedded inside an attacker-controlled iframe, leading to clickjacking attacks.

5.4 Cookie Security Issues (Low to Medium Risk)

Detected cookie misconfigurations:

Cookies missing HttpOnly flag

Cookies missing SameSite attribute

Security Impact:
Cookies may be accessed via client-side scripts or sent in cross-site requests, increasing session hijacking risk.

5.5 Subresource Integrity (SRI) Missing (Low Risk)

External JavaScript resources loaded without integrity checks

Security Impact:
If a third-party script is compromised, malicious code could be executed on the site.

5.6 Information Disclosure Issues (Low Risk)

X-Powered-By header exposed

Internal implementation details visible in responses

Security Impact:
Helps attackers fingerprint backend technologies.

6. Risk Classification Summary
Risk Level	Count
Medium	Majority of alerts
Low	Several alerts
High	None
Informational	Few

Analysis:
No critical vulnerabilities were found, but multiple security misconfigurations were identified that require attention.

7. Ethical Considerations

No exploitation attempted

No payload injection performed

Only automated and passive scanning used

Scanning conducted strictly for educational purposes

False positives reviewed before documentation

8. Security Recommendations
Vulnerability	Recommended Fix
CSRF Missing	Implement CSRF tokens in all forms
Weak CSP	Enforce strict CSP headers
Clickjacking	Add X-Frame-Options: DENY
Cookie Issues	Enable HttpOnly and SameSite
Info Disclosure	Remove unnecessary headers
SRI Missing	Add integrity attributes to scripts
9. Project Conclusion

This project demonstrated the effective use of OWASP ZAP to perform a comprehensive security assessment of a real-world web application. Using automated scans, traditional spidering, and AJAX spidering, multiple security weaknesses were identified, primarily related to missing security headers, CSRF protection, and client-side security policies.

The results highlight the importance of secure configuration and proactive vulnerability scanning in modern web applications.
